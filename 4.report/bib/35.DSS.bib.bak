  abstract  = {{An attractive and sustainable railway traffic system is characterized by
   having a high security, high accessibility, high energy performance and
   offering reliable services with sufficient punctuality. At the same
   time, the network is to be utilized to a large extent in a
   cost-effective way. This requires a continuous balance between
   maintaining a high utilization and sufficiently high robustness to
   minimize the sensitivity to disturbances. The occurrence of some
   disturbances can be prevented to some extent but the occurrence of
   unpredictable events are unavoidable and their consequences then need to
   be analyzed, minimized and communicated to the affected users. Valuable
   information necessary to perform a complete consequence analysis of a
   disturbance and the re-scheduling is however not always available for
   the traffic managers. With current conditions, it is also not always
   possible for the traffic managers to take this information into account
   since he or she needs to act fast without any decision-support assisting
   in computing an effective re-scheduling solution. In previous research
   we have designed an optimization-based approach for re-scheduling which
   seems promising. However, for certain scenarios it is difficult to find
   good solutions within seconds. Therefore, we have developed a greedy
   algorithm which effectively delivers good solutions within the permitted
   time as a complement to the previous approach. To quickly retrieve a
   feasible solution the algorithm performs a depth-first search using an
   evaluation function to prioritise when conflicts arise and then branches
   according to a set of criteria. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

   (2) ``Investment Selection Model,{''} which determines the portions of

   trade-off between capital investment and delay cost. This research also

   North American class 1 railroads. On the basis of the network
   characteristics, estimated future demand, and available budget, this
   decision support framework can successfully determine the optimal

  abstract = {The energy consumption of trains is highly efficient due to the low friction between steel wheels and rails, although the efficiency is also influenced largely by the driving strategy applied and the scheduled running times in the timetable. Optimal energy-efficient driving strategies can reduce operating costs significantly and contribute to a further increase of the sustainability of railway transportation. The railway sector hence shows an increasing interest in efficient algorithms for energy-efficient train control, which could be used in real-time Driver Advisory Systems (DAS) or Automatic Train Operation (ATO) systems. This paper gives an extensive literature review on energy-efficient train control (EETC) and the related topic of energy-efficient train timetabling (EETT), from the first simple models from the 1960s of a train running on a level track to the advanced models and algorithms of the last decade dealing with varying gradients and speed limits, and including regenerative braking. Pontryagin’s Maximum Principle (PMP) has been applied intensively to derive optimal driving regimes that make up the optimal energy-efficient driving strategy of a train under different conditions. Still, the optimal sequence and switching points of the optimal driving regimes are not trivial in general, which led to a wide range of optimization models and algorithms to compute the optimal train trajectories and more recently to use them to optimize timetables with a trade-off between energy efficiency and travel times.},
