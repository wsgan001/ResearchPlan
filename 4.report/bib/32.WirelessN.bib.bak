  abstract      = {Wireless technology has been regarded as a paradigm shifter in the process industry. The first open wireless communication standard specifically designed for process measurement and control applications, WirelessHART was officially released in September 2007 (as a part of the HART 7 Specification). WirelessHART is a secure and TDMA-based wireless mesh networking technology operating in the 2.4GHz ISM radio band. In this paper, we give an introduction to the architecture of WirelessHART and share our first-hand experience in building a prototype for this specification. We describe several challenges we had to tackle during the implementation, such as the design of the timer, network wide synchronization, communication security, reliable mesh networking, and the central network manager. For each challenge, we provide a detailed analysis and propose our solution. Based on the prototype implementation, a simple WirelessHART network has been built for the purpose of demonstration. The demonstration network in turn validates our design. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported effort to build a WirelessHART protocol stack. © 2008 IEEE.},

  abstract = {Recent human effort has been directed at expanding pervasive smart environments. For this, ubiquitous computing technology is introduced to provide all users with any service, anytime, anywhere, with any device, and under any network. However, high cost, long time consumption, extensive effort, and in some cases irrevocability are the main challenges and difficulties for developing ubiquitous systems. Therefore, one solution is to initially simulate, analyze, and validate practices prior to deploying sensing and computational devices in the real world. Simulation, as a performance evaluation technique, has attracted attentions due to its speed, cost-effectiveness, repeatability, scalability, flexibility, and ease of implementation. Moreover, emulation, as a hybrid method, not only offers most simulation advantages but also benefits from tight control of implementation, as well as a certain degree of realistic results. Both simulators and emulators are significant tools for enhancing the understanding of ubiquitous sensor networks (USNs) through testing and analyzing several scenarios prior to actual sensor placements. In this regard, this paper surveys 130 simulation and emulation environments and frameworks, which were originally designed and adapted for USN. Of these 130, the 22 that have been widely used, regularly updated, and well supported by their developers are compared based on multifarious criteria. Finally, several studies that had favorably compared the performance of simulators and/or emulators are examined. We believe the present research findings will be helpful for students and researchers to pick an appropriate simulator/emulator, and for software developers and those who are keen on producing their own environment.},
