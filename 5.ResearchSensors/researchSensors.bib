  abstract        = {Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) pose several problems in terms of scalability and energy consumption. Many of them have been treated in the literature by means of optimization techniques. Depending on the optimization goal and constraints, a great number of these problems are solved using Linear Programming (LP) techniques whenever possible or the network model is further simplified to fit into this category, albeit accuracy may be degraded. In many other cases, simplifying the network model is not feasible and optimization requires more complex techniques. For these cases, non-linear optimization becomes an interesting alternative. Non-linear optimization is beneficial provided that more accurate results are needed or linear optimization is not achievable or yields unreliable results. This paper surveys recent and significant contributions regarding non-linear optimization problems in WSN, selecting the most relevant objectives to optimize and classify the problems under consideration into several categories. Furthermore, this work provides insights in many important problems requiring non-linear optimization and, finally, discusses current open questions in this area. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

Since WSN can both sense the environment and apply algorithms to process the data, more real-time and useful information can be gathered from the physical world than using traditional sensing systems. These networks can also be integrated into the "Internet of Things" in order to allow collaboration and wider access to sensor data.

Structural health monitoring systems are widely adopted to monitor the behavior of structures during forced vibration testing or natural excitation (e.g. earthquakes, winds, live loading). They can be found in a number of civil structures, including bridges and viaducts, and also in applications of vehicle health monitoring. Moreover, since infrastructures can be damaged by human originated threats, the adoption of security measures is also essential. This paper presents a proposal of an early warning system based on Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) for railway infrastructure monitoring.

This has led to a rapid expansion in condition monitoring of systems, structures, vehicles, and machinery using sensors. Key factors are the recent advances in networking technologies such as wireless communication and mobile ad hoc networking coupled with the technology to integrate devices. Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) can be used for monitoring the railway infrastructure such as bridges, rail tracks, track beds, and track equipment along with vehicle health monitoring such as chassis, bogies, wheels, and wagons. Condition monitoring reduces human inspection requirements through automated monitoring, reduces maintenance through detecting faults before they escalate, and improves safety and reliability. This is vital for the development, upgrading, and expansion of railway networks. This paper surveys these wireless sensors network technology for monitoring in the railway industry for analyzing systems, structures, vehicles, and machinery. This paper focuses on practical engineering solutions, principally, which sensor devices are used and what they are used for; and the identification of sensor configurations and network topologies. It identifies their respective motivations and distinguishes their advantages and disadvantages in a comparative review. © 2000-2011 IEEE.},
