  abstract        = {Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) pose several problems in terms of scalability and energy consumption. Many of them have been treated in the literature by means of optimization techniques. Depending on the optimization goal and constraints, a great number of these problems are solved using Linear Programming (LP) techniques whenever possible or the network model is further simplified to fit into this category, albeit accuracy may be degraded. In many other cases, simplifying the network model is not feasible and optimization requires more complex techniques. For these cases, non-linear optimization becomes an interesting alternative. Non-linear optimization is beneficial provided that more accurate results are needed or linear optimization is not achievable or yields unreliable results. This paper surveys recent and significant contributions regarding non-linear optimization problems in WSN, selecting the most relevant objectives to optimize and classify the problems under consideration into several categories. Furthermore, this work provides insights in many important problems requiring non-linear optimization and, finally, discusses current open questions in this area. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

These sensors generally work in a severe environment, so the key problem for sensor data acquisition is to ensure data accuracy and reliability. In this paper, we follow the sequence of sensor signal flow, present sensor signal sensing technology, sensor data acquisition, and processing technology, as well as sensor fault diagnosis technology based on the voltage, current, speed, and temperature sensors which are commonly used in train traction systems. Finally, intelligent sensors and future research directions of rail transit train sensors are discussed. © 2017 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

One way or another, sensor data will ultimately be used for control purpose. Smart sensor and smart sensor networks will go beyond raw signal and/or data, and provide certain level of information and/or knowledge, which can significantly improve the overall control system perform and reduce reliability. This paper gives a brief introduction on smart sensor and smart sensor networks and their progresses. Some issues observed are also highlighted. By raising people's attention and interests, authors believe that researchers/developers from both academic and industrial societies can and should work together to address those issues and promote the development of smart sensor and smart sensor networks.},

In recent years, WSN technology has proven to be beneficial in health and environmental monitoring, military applications, and many other fields. Since WSN can both sense the environment and apply algorithms to process the data, more real-time and useful information can be gathered from the physical world than using traditional sensing systems. These networks can also be integrated into the "Internet of Things" in order to allow collaboration and wider access to sensor data. This paper will explore the challenges faced by WSNs and how they can be addressed, from hardware and software aspects to security, which is especially important in an internet context. © 2013 IEEE.},
