	%	Back to the 19th century, the steam turbine was the main propulsion system for the trains. Later on, electric and diesel propulsion systems were adopted. In recent years occurred a massive introduction of power converters based on \ac{IGBT}, which allowed an increase of energy efficiency (allowing, for example, regenerative breaking and reduction of power losses in traction motors).
		
	%	Due to this evolution, different topologies of the railway system exists nowadays. In table \ref{tab:31.t1}, different catenary topologies are visible which results in different power systems for \ac{RTS}.
