		\begin{itemize}
			\item \textbf{New energy metering architecture}, according to some specifications such as the usage of a non-intrusive approach.
			This architecture will generate energy information about the power flow of the railway system.
			
			\item \textbf{Accurate estimation of power flow} into catenary, based on on-board measurements. The available parameters will be: (1) the RMS voltage, current and apparent power, (2) the instantaneous active power, reactive power, power factor and frequency, and (3) the cumulative energy consumptions in terms of kVAh, kVARh and KWh.

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Availability of measured data} from trains where currently limited/inexistent energy measurement is performed.

\item Data-rate increase of energy measurements, which will result on direct \textbf{increase on the quality of information of energy}. This increase will overcome the 5-minute data-rate that currently are used in energy meters.

\item A further contribution can be the reduction of the dependence of broadband real-time/continuous communication (such as \ac{LTE}), with the direct cost reduction of information transmission of energy \ac{RTS} data.
