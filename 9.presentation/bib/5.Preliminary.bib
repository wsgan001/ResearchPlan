  abstract = {Monitoring current and voltage waveforms is essential to evaluate the energy consumption of a system and to improve its efficiency. In this paper we present a smart meter for power consumption which can measure both current and voltage without any physical contact to the electric load or to the conductors of the power cables. This makes the power metering much safer and easier; furthermore an energy harvesting module based on inductive coupling provides power supply to the meter without any need of batteries or plugs to the mains. We describe the innovative contact-less voltage measurement system, which is based on capacitive coupling and uses an algorithm with two pre-processing channels for self-calibration and to provide accurate measurements regardless the cable type. The three-phase version is capable of measuring the three-phase power consumption of an electric load in a complete contact-less manner. In comparison with commercial high-cost instruments, experimental results of our low-cost smart meter demonstrate similar high performance with maximum 3Â {\%} deviation from the reference value.},
